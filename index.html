                Hey there! My name is Saifullah Ahmed. I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science through the College
                of Engineering at the Unversity of Michigan.

                While a majority of my time is spent doing HW, writing code, or studying for exams, in my free time I like to
                play sports, hangout with friends, and workout. My favorite sports would have to be football and volleyball.
                This semester I actually found an interest in Jiu Jutsu as well and have been attending open mats here on
                campus.

                Being Computer Science, you may be wondering what languages I know as well as what projects I have completed.
                Feel free to click on the 
                <a href="project.html">Projects</a> page for more details. But for a quick overview I have programmed in 
                C++/C, Python, and am currently practicing my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript development.
